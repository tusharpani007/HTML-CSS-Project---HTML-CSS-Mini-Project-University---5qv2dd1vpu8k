                <li>Mechanical Engineering</li><br>
                <p> Mechanical Engineering is an undergraduate engineering programme that focuses on providing the 
                    students with basic knowledge regarding how heavy tools and machinery work. Q. What is the duration
                     of Mechanical Engineering? A. The duration of Mechanical Engineering is 4 years.
                     Candidates who wish to pursue an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering can pursue 
                     it under two different degrees- B.Tech or a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.), both of which are 
                     4-year courses that cover the breadth of the subject and 
                     result in candidates being fully prepared to enter the industry. 

                     Admissions to this course are conducted based on several entrance exams at the national, 
                     state, and even university level; candidates must attend the relevant exam and clear the 
                     cut off as specified by the institute to gain admission. Some of the top entrance exams include:

                    include recorded auto-graded and peer-reviewed assignments, video lectures, 
                    and community discussion forums. When you complete a course, you’ll be eligible 
                    to receive a shareable electronic Course Certificate for a small fee.</p><br>
                <li>Computer Science Engineering</li><br>
                <p>Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is a unique combination of electrical 
                    engineering, mathematical and linguistics, which involves learning about a 
                    variety of topics such as computation, algorithm analysis, developing new programs and applications,
                     software development and hardware learning, etc.
                     Computer science engineering course has a curriculum that entails both theoretical and practical 
                     knowledge through its subjects. Every semester has one compulsory industrial internship along with
                      a programming language subject. The rest subjects are divided on the basis of their functional 
                      specialization and application in computer science.
                    </p><br>
                <li>Civil Engineering</li><br>
                <p>Civil engineering degree holders can go for various advance courses in Drafting and Design,
